# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting
The report for the assignment is segmented into three distinct tasks, each focusing on the analysis of specific
time series data. In the initial task, we scrutinize five weekly series from 2010-2020, which include mortality,
temperature, particle size of pollutants, and two chemical emissions named chem1 and chem2. The objective
is to forecast mortality four weeks into the future. The subsequent task revolves around predicting FFD for the
next four years by leveraging various climate indicators. The third task is bifurcated into sections (a) and (b).
The former involves a univariate analysis of RBO, employing individual climate predictors to project its values
for the coming three years. Meanwhile, section (b) necessitates another three-year forecast for RBO, this time
factoring in the effects of the Australian drought that spanned from 1996 to 2009.
